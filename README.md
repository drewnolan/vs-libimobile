# vs-libimobile
Updated for iOS11

This was originally offered as https://www.npmjs.com/package/vs-libimobile on npm.
I needed a version that worked with iOS11, so I hacked together stuff from https://github.com/rcmpayne/libimobiledevice-Compiled-Windows and also from https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy#installation and layed them over the original to make this, which appears to work for me, **HOWEVER YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY**
